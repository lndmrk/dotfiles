#+TITLE: lndmrk's dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Emil Lundmark

These are my personal dotfiles organized into /bundles/. A bundle is essentially
a Python module and a collection of dotfiles without the initial dot in the
name; it's implied.

* Usage

The =dotfiles= program is used to orchestrate everything. It can be installed by
running

#+begin_example
$ ./dotfiles install
#+end_example

The program will find any bundles relative to this directory. It will also
handle any inner Git repositories along with its bundles.

* Test

A set of compliance tests can be run with

#+begin_example
$ ./test
#+end_example

This should be configured to run before every commit.

#+begin_example
$ ln -s "$(pwd)/test" "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/hooks/pre-commit"
#+end_example
