#+TITLE: lndmrk's dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Emil Lundmark

This is the public part of my dotfiles. They are organized as separate /bundles/
that can be enabled individually. Evetyhing is orchestrated by the /dotfiles/
bundle; it contains the =dotfiles= tool which can be used to easily manage all
bundles.

Additional private bundles should be collected in a subdirectory to this
repository. The name should start with =private=, since that is ignored by Git.

* Install

Install by running the following.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ . bootstrap.sh
$ dotfiles enable
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Test

Some sanity tests can be preformed. They can either be run directly on your
machine with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ dotfiles test
#+END_EXAMPLE

or inside a sandbox with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ dotfiles test --sandbox
#+END_EXAMPLE

The sandbox tests require that [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]] and a
supported provider is available.
