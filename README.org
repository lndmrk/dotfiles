* lndmrk's dotfiles

This is the public part of my dotfiles. Private configurations can be put in the
directory =local/=. You can also have a =local/setup-local.sh= that is run as
part of the setup.

** Install

Install by running the following.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ./setup
$ cd common/
$ stow */
#+END_EXAMPLE

Also install local packages, if any.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd local/
$ stow */
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Test

Some sanity tests can be preformed. They can either be run directly on your
machine with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ./test
#+END_EXAMPLE

or inside a sandbox with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ./test-sandbox
#+END_EXAMPLE

The sandbox tests require that [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]] and a supported provider is available.
